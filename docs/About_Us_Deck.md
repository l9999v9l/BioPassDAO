# About Us — BioPassDAO (Three-slide overview)

This repository contains a compact three-slide About Us deck in SVG format (docs/About_Us_Deck.svg). Use the SVG to export a PDF (many vector editors or Inkscape/Adobe Illustrator can export to PDF). If you prefer, I can render and commit a PDF export — tell me and I'll add it.

Slides included:
1. Mission & Problem
2. Solution & Tokenomics
3. Roadmap & Team

Assets:
- assets/logo.svg — project monogram with Polygon and Binance color accents
- assets/mantra-scroll.svg — minimal modern mantra & embedded Solidity contract
- contracts/LongevityDAO.sol — Solidity contract file

To export to PDF locally (example using Inkscape):

inkscape docs/About_Us_Deck.svg --export-type=pdf --export-filename=docs/About_Us_Deck.pdf
